"""NIST validation tests for compound data.

This package contains validation tests that verify compound thermophysical properties
against authoritative NIST WebBook values. Per Constitution Principle III, all data
must be validated against literature sources within acceptable tolerances.

Tests are marked with @pytest.mark.validation and can be run separately:
    pytest -m validation
