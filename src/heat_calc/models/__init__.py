"""Pydantic data models for heat exchanger calculations.

This module contains input/output models for each calculation domain:
- LMTD models (LMTDInput, LMTDResult)
- NTU models (NTUInput, NTUResult)
- Convection models (ConvectionGeometry, ConvectionResult)
- Insulation models (InsulationInput, InsulationResult)

All models are Pydantic v2 with Pint unit validation.
