"""Heat Exchanger Calculations Library.

This module provides a comprehensive library for heat exchanger calculations including:
- LMTD method (Log Mean Temperature Difference)
- NTU method (Number of Transfer Units - Effectiveness)
- Convection correlations (heat transfer coefficients)
- Insulation sizing (economic thickness optimization)

All calculations are validated against published references (Incropera, NIST).
